# API v3

This describes the resources that make up the official GitHub API v3. If
you have any problems or requests please contact
[support](mailto:support@github.com?subject=APIv3).

**Note:** This API is in a beta state. Breaking changes may occur.

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.github.com`
domain.  All data is sent and received as JSON.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.github.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999
Content-Length: 2

{}
</pre>

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## Client Errors

There are three possible types of client errors on API calls that
receive request bodies:

1. Sending invalid JSON will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Length: 35

        {"message":"Problems parsing JSON"}

2. Sending the wrong type of JSON values will result in a `400 Bad
   Request` response.

        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Length: 40

        {"message":"Body should be a JSON Hash"}

3. Sending invalid files will result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity
   response.

        HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
        Content-Length: 149

        {
          "message": "Validation Failed",
          "errors": [
            {
              "resource": "Issue",
              "field": "title",
              "code": "missing_field"
            }
          ]
        }

All error objects have resource and field properties so that your client
can tell what the problem is.  There's also an error code to let you
know what is wrong with the field.  These are the possible validation error 
codes:

missing
: This means a resource does not exist.

missing\_field
: This means a required field on a resource has not been set.

invalid
: This means the formatting of a field is invalid.  The documentation
for that resource should be able to give you more specific information.

already\_exists
: This means another resource has the same value as this field.  This
can happen in resources that must have some unique key (such as Label
names).

If resources have custom validation errors, they will be documented with
the resource.

## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, API v3 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.

HEAD
: Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.

GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such as
merging a pull request).

PATCH
: Used for updating resources with partial JSON data.  For instance, an
Issue resource has `title` and `body` attributes.  A PATCH request may
accept one or more of the attributes to update the resource.  PATCH is a
relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept
POST requests.

PUT
: Used for replacing resources or collections.

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through GitHub API v3:

Basic Authentication:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u "username:PASSWORD" https://api.github.com
</pre>

OAuth2 Token (sent in a header):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com
</pre>

OAuth2 Token (sent as a parameter):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN
</pre>

Read [more about OAuth2](/v3/oauth/).

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 30 items by
default.  You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter.  You
can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `?per_page` parameter.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos?page=2&per_page=100
</pre>

The pagination info is included in [the Link header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/9707-link-header.html):

    Link: <https://api.github.com/repos?page=3&per_page=100>; rel="next",
      <https://api.github.com/repos?page=50&per_page=100>; rel="last"

_Linebreak is included for readability._

The possible `rel` values are:

`next`
: Shows the URL of the immediate next page of results.

`last`
: Shows the URL of the last page of results.

`first`
: Shows the URL of the first page of results.

`prev`
: Shows the URL of the immediate previous page of results.

## Rate Limiting

We limit requests to API v3 to 5000 per hour.  This is keyed off either your
login, your OAuth token, or request IP.  You can check the returned HTTP
headers of any API request to see your current status:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/whatever

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4966
</pre>

You can file a [support issue](http://support.github.com/dashboard/queues/2386-api)
to request white listed access for your application.  We prefer sites that
setup OAuth applications for their users.

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

The API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests.
you can read the [CORS W3C working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors), or
[this intro](http://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/CrossOriginRequestSecurity) from the
HTML 5 Security Guide.

Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting
`http://some-site.com`:

    $ curl -i https://api.github.com -H "Origin: http://some-site.com" 
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found

Any domain that is registered as an OAuth Application is accepted.
Here's a sample request for a browser hitting [Calendar About Nothing](http://calendaraboutnothing.com/):

    $ curl -i https://api.github.com -H "Origin: http://calendaraboutnothing.com" 
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://calendaraboutnothing.com
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Link, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

This is what the CORS preflight request looks like:

    $ curl -i https://api.github.com -H "Origin: http://calendaraboutnothing.com" -X OPTIONS    
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://calendaraboutnothing.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, X-Requested-With
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Link, X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-OAuth-Scopes, X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function.  This is typically used when browsers want
to embed GitHub content in web pages by getting around cross domain
issues.  The response includes the same data output as the regular API,
plus the relevant HTTP Header information.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com?callback=foo

foo({
  "meta": {
    "status": 200,
    "X-RateLimit-Limit": "5000",
    "X-RateLimit-Remaining": "4966",
    "Link": [ // pagination headers and other links
      ["https://api.github.com?page=2", {"rel": "next"}]
    ]
  },
  "data": {
    // the data
  }
})
</pre>

You can write a javascript handler to process the callback like this:

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript">function foo(response) {
  var meta = response.meta
  var data = response.data
  console.log(meta)
  console.log(data)
}</code></pre>

All of the headers are the same String value as the HTTP Headers with one
notable exception: Link.  Link headers are pre-parsed for you and come
through as an array of `[url, options]` tuples.

A link that looks like this:

    Link: <url1>; rel="next", <url2>; rel="foo"; bar="baz"

... will look like this in the Callback output:

<%= json "Link" => [
  ["url1", {:rel => "next"}],
  ["url2", {:rel => "foo", :bar => "baz"}]] %>

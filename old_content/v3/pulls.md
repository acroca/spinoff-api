# Pull Request API

Pull Requests leverage [these](#custom-mime-types) custom mime types. You
can read more about the use of mime types in the API

## Link Relations

Pull Requests have these possible link relations:

`self`
: The API location of this Pull Request.

`html`
: The HTML location of this Pull Request.

`comments`
: The API location of this Pull Request's Issue comments.

`review_comments`
: The API location of this Pull Request's Review comments.

## List pull requests

    GET /repos/:user/:repo/pulls

### Parameters

state
: _Optional_ **string** - `open` or `closed` to filter by state. Default
is `open`.

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:pull) { |h| [h] } %>

## Get a single pull request

    GET /repos/:user/:repo/pulls/:id

body

base
: _Required_ **string** - The branch (or git ref) you want your changes pulled into.
This should be an existing branch on the current repository.  You cannot
submit a pull request to one repo that requests a merge to a base of
another repo.

  :body      => "Please pull this in!",
  :head      => "octocat:new-feature",
  :base      => "master",
%>

### Alternative Input

You can also create a Pull Request from an existing Issue by passing an
Issue number instead of `title` and `body`.

Pull Request.

  :issue => "5",
  :head  => "ocotocat:new-feature",
